# BHAS - CAN Dump

Dumps all received CAN messages via serial port.

Example:

```
_32791ms_ (5057ms since previous) CAN message received: [CANID = 1337]: 0x07 0x08 0x09
```

There is currently no message parsing or what ever implemented. Pure message dump.

This little firmware is part of Bio Home Automator System - BHAS (pronounced BeeHas) and is designed for the LPC1768.
